 PolyglotDesk - Notes & Challenges

1. Googletrans API sometimes fails with certain languages (API limit or internet issues).
   → I added try/except to show error instead of breaking.

2. Hindi text sometimes appears as "????" due to missing fonts on some systems.
   → Solution: Install proper system fonts for Hindi.

3. Added a warning if user tries to translate empty text.
